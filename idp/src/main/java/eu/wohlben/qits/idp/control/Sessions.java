/**
 * Browser sessions: opening one, resolving one, ending one.
 *
 * <p><b>The cookie is opaque and the row is the truth.</b> A session's value is 256 random bits and
 * nothing else — no user id encoded in it, no signature to verify, no way to tell a valid one from
 * a made-up one without asking this store. What is stored is a {@code sha-256:} fingerprint, so a
 * dump of the idp's database logs nobody in, exactly as a dump of {@code idp_client} mints nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>Why not a signed cookie the edge could verify offline.</b> A JWT in the cookie would let the
 * edge check a session against the JWKS it already holds, with no call here at all — and it would
 * cost revocation, because there is no revocation list and validation would be offline. The edge
 * introspects and caches instead: the same shape as its Basic-credential cache, logout is a row
 * update, and the only thing bought back is a lag of seconds. That trade is the plan's decision.
 *
 * <p><b>Expiry is absolute.</b> A session dies {@code qits.idp.session-ttl} after it was opened,
 * whatever the user did in between. Sliding renewal and "remember me" are named open questions, not
 * missing features — and neither is a blocker, because logging in again is one ceremony.
