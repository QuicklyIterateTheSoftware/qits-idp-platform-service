/**
 * One registered authenticator — a passkey.
 *
 * <p><b>These fields are not a design.</b> They are exactly {@code
 * WebAuthnCredentialRecord.RequiredPersistedData} from quarkus-security-webauthn 3.34.6, read off
 * the extension's own source: that record is what {@code fromRequiredPersistedData} reassembles a
 * usable credential out of when a login arrives, so anything missing here is a login that cannot be
 * verified. The record's own {@code username} member is the one thing not stored — the join to
 * {@link IdpUser} carries it, and a second copy would be a second spelling of the same account.
 *
 * <p>{@link #counter} is the part that is not merely storage: an authenticator's signature counter
 * only ever increases, so a login presenting a counter that did not move forward is a cloned
 * authenticator and webauthn4j refuses it. That check only works if the new value is written back
 * on every successful login, which is why this column is updated rather than written once.
 *
 * <p>Many rows per user is the intended shape: a second authenticator is added from a logged-in
 * session, and removing one is a delete here.
