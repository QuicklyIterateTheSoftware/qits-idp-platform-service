/**
 * Turning a register token into an account — the one operation in this service that writes five
 * tables and must write all of them or none.
 *
 * <p>This is the only class that knows {@link Users}, {@link RegisterTokens} and {@link Sessions}
 * all exist, the same way {@link ClientRegistry} is the only class that knows both halves of the
 * client registry do. Each of those three does one thing at a time and owns its own transaction; a
 * registration is the composite, so the boundary moves here and theirs is not used.
 *
 * <p><b>What "all or none" is protecting.</b> Five writes go in: the account, its factor (a passkey
 * or a password), the token's consumption, the two bootstrap roles, and the session. Every partial
 * outcome is a bad one, and two are genuinely dangerous — a token spent against an account that was
 * never created leaves an installation with no way in and a one-time ticket already gone, and an
 * account created without the token being spent leaves the ticket good for a second account nobody
 * asked for. One transaction is what makes both unreachable.
 *
 * <p><b>And it is {@link DbRetry#inNewTx}, not {@link DbRetry#call}.</b> The retry has to own the
 * boundary so that it knows which failures certainly did not commit; a commit whose acknowledgement
 * was lost is reported rather than repeated, because repeating this one would try to insert an
 * account that is already there and fail on the unique name — a confusing answer to a registration
 * that in fact worked. The same reasoning as a commission, one table wider.
