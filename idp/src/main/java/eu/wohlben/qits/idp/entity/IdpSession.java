/**
 * One browser session — the row behind the {@code qits-session} cookie.
 *
 * <p><b>The cookie is opaque and this row is the truth.</b> The cookie carries 256 random bits;
 * {@link #tokenHash} is their {@code sha-256:} fingerprint, so a dump of this database logs nobody
 * in. The edge introspects here and caches the answer, which is what keeps logout and revocation
 * row updates rather than cryptography. The alternative considered and refused — a JWT cookie the
 * edge verifies offline against the JWKS it already holds — costs exactly revocation and buys only
 * tolerance of an idp outage, which the edge's cache grace buys back.
 *
 * <p><b>Three columns decide whether a session is live, and none of them is a constraint.</b>
 * {@link #expiresAt} is the absolute deadline stamped at creation ({@code qits.idp.session-ttl});
 * {@link #revokedAt} is logout, <b>set rather than deleted</b> so that a session which ended is
 * distinguishable from one that never existed. A reader compares both against the clock, because
 * "expired" is a fact about the clock and not about the row.
 *
 * <p>Revocation lags at the edge by its introspection cache TTL — seconds, configurable, and named
 * in the plan so nobody files it as a bug.
