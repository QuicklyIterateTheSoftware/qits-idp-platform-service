 * no structure to parse, no id encoded in it, and no way to recognise a valid one without asking
 * the store.
 *
 * <p><b>The generator is constructed per call and must never become a static field.</b> A {@code
 * SecureRandom} held in a static is instantiated during native-image generation and lands in the
 * image heap with its seed baked in — every deployment of that binary would then mint the same
 * secrets. GraalVM refuses to build it, which is how this was caught here rather than shipped
 * (measured 2026-08-14, {@code DynamicClients} was written that way first). None of these is a hot
 * path, so constructing one costs nothing worth the risk.
